ZZLIB is a library based on ZZIP, it uses the same algorithms as Zzip and
enables you to compress memory block. You are free to use this library in your 
program and you are free to distribute this libray with your program, but you
have to mention somewhere in your program that it uses Zzlib.

Have a look at Zzip documentation if you want further information about Zzip
and Zzlib.

At Zzip website, you can download an example (dlltest.zip), for MS VC++ 5.0
or GCC-MINGW32, using Zzlib.

The source code of Zzlib is released under the GNU LGPL, you can download it
at Zzip/Zzlib website.

Warning : since this software is still in development, different versions are 
not cross-compatible. It means that a memory block compressed with zzlib may not
be uncompressed with a different (newer or older) version of zzlib.
