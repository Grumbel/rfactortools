            ..:: rFactor to Game Stock Car 2013 ::..
            ========================================

This application allows you to convert rFactor mods so that they can
be used with Game Stock Car 2013. Conversation is for most part
automatic, but some issues may remain, the file FAQ.md explains how to
fix or work around some of them.

To convert a mod:

1) extract it or if it comes as .exe install it into an empty directory

2) select the directory where you installed the mod as "Input"

3) select the directory where you want the conversion to be copied to
   as "Output". Installing directly into the GSC2013 is not
   recommended, use an empty directory instead.

4) Hit the "Convert" button and wait a minute or two.

5) Once the conversion is finished copy the mod over to the GSC2013
   directory

6) If you have converted a track, install gsc2013-missing-track-textures.7z,
   it's a base mod that contains sky textures necessary to run converted mods.
   It's available at:

   https://mega.co.nz/#!zlRFTAjD!byvxHGBi-19Cj9maG4bSTUqMX19lJuULKCAQbQ7Lr0g

7) If something goes wrong, full conversion logs are saved to
   rfactortools-gui-*.log. For further tweaking, minised-gui.exe, a
   tool that allows you to search&replace across multiple files is
   included with rfactortools.

8) If you want to report a bug or request a feature, you can do so at:

   https://github.com/Grumbel/rfactortools/issues

Car mods will show up in the same class as the Mini Challenge.


Options:
--------

Unique Team Names:
Adds a suffix to the 'Team' name in .veh files to make them unique and
avoid conflicts with other mods

Force Track Thumbnail:
Always generate a new track thumbnail, ignoring the one from the
original mod

Clear Vehicle Classes:
Empties the "Classes" tag in the .veh file and only uses the content of
"Reiza Class", useful when in cases where

Vehicle Category ("Category" tag in .veh files):
Allows you to add a new folder for the car mod in the vehicle list,
useful in cases the mod doesn't provide one by itself. Multiple
folders can be created by separating the names with a comma, e.g.
"Formula 1, 1994".

Track Category (aka "VenueName" tag in .gdb files):
Allows you to add a new folder for the car mod in the track list,
useful in cases the mod doesn't provide one by itself. Multiple
folders can be created by separating the names with a comma, e.g.
"Anderstorp GP, 2003".

Reiza Class (aka "Classes" tag in .veh files):
Allows you to prepend a class to the "Classes" tag in the .veh file.
Only vehicles containing a reiza class will show up in GSC2013. Valid
classes are:

reiza1: Camaro
reiza2: ???
reiza3: ???
reiza4: ???
reiza5: Mini
reiza6: Opala
reiza7: Kart Direct
reiza8: Kart Bodywork
reiza9: Formula Retro
reiza10: Kart Shifter

You can specify multiple classes by separating them by comma, e.g.
"reiza5, Formula1 1994", useful in combination with "Clear Vehicle
Classes".

Track Filter Properties:
The filter decides which cars can race on a track. The default of
"StockV8 *" means all race cars can race on the track. If you want to
race on a track with karts, change it to "Kart *".
